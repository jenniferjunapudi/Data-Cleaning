## SQL Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains the code and data for a recent SQL data cleaning project focused on preparing a complex dataset for analysis, ensuring data quality and reliability. The project involved utilizing advanced SQL techniques to transform and cleanse the data.

### Project Highlights

During the project, the following tasks were performed:

1.**Extensive Data Wrangling**: A comprehensive data wrangling process was conducted to prepare the complex dataset for analysis. This involved addressing data qulaity issues, ensuring data reliability, and optimizing the dataset for subsequent analysis.

2.**Data Transformation and Cleansing**: Advanced SQL techniques such as CASE statements, JOIN operations, views, and Common Table Expression (CTEs) were utilized to transform and cleanse the data. These techniques allowed for efficient data manipulation and handling complex data transformations.

### Files
